Hey, how's everyone? I'm here to share this Python code that helps you create a 5-letter name.

Okay, I'll explain each file. The maker.py file is used to create 5-digit names. How many do you want the code to generate, for example 3000? The maximum is 50000.

Roblox.py is used to help the code detect which usernames work

Okay, I'll explain something about the code, because the code doesn't generate 4-digit usernames. No matter how many you generate, you can remove the maximum of 50,000 and increase it even to 1 trillion, but none of them will work, even if you get lucky, I guess lol.

You can try setting it to generate 4 digits as I've shown in this image in maker.py

Please don't make this code your own, Or don't even try to sell it, it's for y'all, peace.
